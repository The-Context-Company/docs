The Context Company supports multiple environments to fit your development workflow—from local debugging to production monitoring.

## Production (Cloud-Hosted)

The production environment provides full-featured observability for your live AI agents. Monitor real user interactions, detect silent failures at scale, and get alerts when issues arise.

**Production features include:**

- **Detailed traces**: Understand every agent run's execution flow, reasoning steps, and tool calls
- **Silent failure detection**: Automatic detection of hallucinations, bad tool calls, infinite loops, and user frustration
- **Search, filter, and sort**: Query across all agent runs, steps, and tool calls with custom metadata filtering
- **User feedback collection**: Capture thumbs up/down ratings and text feedback from end users
- **Agent sessions**: Group related runs into sessions to track full user conversations
- **Aggregate metrics**: Dashboard views of latency, costs, token usage, success rates, and failure trends
- **Alerts and reports**: Real-time notifications for failure spikes and weekly trend digests

## Development (Cloud-Hosted)

Every user gets a private, cloud-hosted development environment for staging and debugging. Test your integrations and explore traces before shipping to production.

To use dev mode:

1. Set the `TCC_API_KEY` environment variable to your user-level API key (begins with `dev_`)
2. Switch to the development environment in the [dashboard](https://www.thecontext.company/dev/runs)

Development environments are isolated—your staging data never mixes with production.

## Local Mode (Next.js + AI SDK)

[Local mode](/frameworks/ai-sdk/local) provides a local-first development experience for rapid iteration. Run The Context Company directly within your Next.js app. No cloud connection required.

Local mode is ideal for:
- Offline development and debugging
- Fast iteration on agent logic
- Inspecting traces in real-time during development
