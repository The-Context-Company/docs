## What is The Context Company?

The Context Company helps teams understand user behavior and monitor AI agents at scale.

### Understand User Behavior

See where users get confused, frustrated, or stuck so your team can improve your AI with confidence.

### User Intent Detection

Find user pain points in your AI Agents. Detect when users are frustrated, confused, or unhappy with the AI agent.

### Silent Failure Detection

Be alerted when your AI Agent silently fails. Standard monitoring misses the failures that matter most. We catch them all.

- **Bad Tool Calls**: Wrong arguments, wrong timing, wrong results.
- **Infinite Loops**: Same call, over and over, burning tokens and upsetting users.
- **Hallucinations**: Fabricated details presented as facts, leading to user confusion.

### Topic Clustering

See what users actually ask about. Stop reading through every conversation to find out what users are asking about.

- Auto-discovered topic clusters
- Track trending issues before they escalate

### User Feedback Analysis

Every thumbs up and thumbs down, analyzed. We analyze every user vote and feedback to identify what your agent does well and where it needs work.

### Custom Pattern Monitoring

Track patterns that matter to your business. Define custom signals like competitor mentions, compliance phrases, and escalation keywords. We'll watch for them across every conversation.

### Alerts & Reports

Get notified when it matters. Real-time alerts for critical issues. Weekly digests with trends and recommendations. Delivered to Slack, email, or wherever your team lives.

- **Instant Alerts**: Failure spikes, unusual patterns, or custom thresholds
- **Weekly Reports**: Trends, top issues, and actionable recommendations

## Technical Metrics

Tokens, latency, and cost tracking. Understand which models perform best, how long they take, and how much they cost.

## Quick Setup

5 lines of code to production. Drop-in observability without modifying your agent logic.
