## What is The Context Company?

The Context Company is an observability platform for AI agents.

We extend traditional observability to uncover **silent and semantic** failures that standard monitoring platforms miss.

## Key Features

- **Aggregate observability**: Large-scale metrics on latency, costs, and tool calls.
- **Detailed traces**: Deeply understand every agent run's execution flow and reasoning.
- **Silent failure detection**: Identify bad tool calls, hallucinations, death loops, and more.
- **Easy integration**: Full integration within ten lines of code.

## Get Started

We currently support the [Vercel AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/), [Claude Agent SDK](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents/), [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com), and [LangGraph](https://www.langgraph.com). More frameworks coming soon.
