## Set TCC environment variables

<Tip>Our SDKs default to using the `TCC_API_KEY` environment variable.</Tip>

```typescript .env.local
TCC_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

## Instrument Claude Agent SDK

#### Step 1: Install dependencies

<CodeGroup>

```Title pnpm
pnpm add @contextcompany/claude @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk
```

```Title npm
npm i @contextcompany/claude @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

#### Step 2: Add instrumentation to your agent

Import the `instrumentClaudeAgent` function and use it to wrap the Claude Agent SDK. This allows your app to export all agent-related traces to The Context Company.

```typescript agent.ts
import { instrumentClaudeAgent } from "@contextcompany/claude";
import * as claudeSDK from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";

const { query, tool, createSdkMcpServer } = instrumentClaudeAgent(claudeSDK);

// Now use query, tool, and createSdkMcpServer as you normally would
```

That's it! All your agent runs will now be automatically tracked in The Context Company.
