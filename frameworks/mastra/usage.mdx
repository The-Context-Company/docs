## Adding custom metadata

Custom metadata allows you to add additional properties to your [agent runs](/concepts#agent-runs).

This is particularly useful for tying agent runs to your own specific business logic, letting you filter and analyze agent runs by user, organization, feature, or some other dimension.

Custom metadata must be passed as a key-value pair to the `metadata` object within `tracingOptions`.

```typescript agent.ts
await agent.stream(
  // ...
  {
    // Pass metadata to track and filter this execution
    tracingOptions: {
      metadata: {
        // e.g. tag this agent run with a user id
        userId: "4a6b111c-b53a-4d00-a877-67185022ab9e",
        customMetadata1: "1234567890",
        customMetadata2: "context is key",
      },
    },
  }
);
```

Agent runs are automatically indexed by your custom metadata fields and can be filtered directly in the dashboard.

### Adding user feedback

User feedback allows you to collect score (thumbs up & thumbs down) and text feedback (up to 2000 characters) from end users on your [agent runs](/concepts#agent-runs).

This is useful for tracking user satisfaction, identifying problematic responses, and filtering agent runs in the dashboard to focus on positive or negative feedback.

#### Step 1: Generate and pass a run ID

```typescript agent.ts
import { randomUUID } from "crypto";

// Generate a unique run ID (must be a UUID) before your agent execution
const runId = randomUUID();

const response = await agent.stream(
  // ...
  {
    tracingOptions: {
      metadata: {
        "tcc.runId": runId, // Pass the run ID in metadata
      },
    },
  }
);

// Return the runId to your client
return { response, runId };
```

#### Step 2: Submit feedback from your client

Store the `runId` on your client, then when the user provides feedback, submit it using the `submitFeedback` function.

Both `score` and `text` are optional, but you must provide at least one:

```typescript feedback-route.ts
import { submitFeedback } from "@contextcompany/mastra";

// Submit both score and text feedback:
await submitFeedback({
  runId: runId, // The run ID from your agent execution
  score: "thumbs_up", // Optional: "thumbs_up" or "thumbs_down"
  text: "This was a helpful response!", // Optional: up to 2000 characters
});
```

Agent runs with feedback can be filtered in the dashboard using the feedback filter.

## Tracking Agent Sessions

[Agent sessions](/concepts#agent-sessions) represents multiple agent runs that are grouped together. The most common use case is tracking entire conversations between a human user and an AI agent in chatbot interfaces.

Agent sessions can be tracked by setting a `tcc.sessionId` key under metadata.

```typescript agent.ts
const sessionId = "unique-session-identifier";

await agent.stream(
  // ...
  {
    tracingOptions: {
      metadata: {
        "tcc.sessionId": sessionId, // Track agent sessions
      },
    },
  }
);
```

The value of `tcc.sessionId` should be a unique identifier for the agent session. This can be any string, but it's generally recommended to use a UUID.

Agent sessions are automatically indexed and can be filtered directly in the dashboard.


## Debug mode

You can enable debug mode, which will log any spans that are created and exported.

```typescript mastra.ts
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";
import { exampleAgent } from "./agents/example-agent";
import { TCCMastraExporter } from "@contextcompany/mastra";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: { exampleAgent },
  observability: {
    configs: {
      otel: {
        serviceName: "mastra-weather-agent",
        exporters: [new TCCMastraExporter({ debug: true })], // Add debug: true here
      },
    },
  },
});
```
